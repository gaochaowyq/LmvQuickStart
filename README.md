# LmvQuickStart

This is a quick start page to get started with Autodesk's Data Management API. All the APIs used here access the developer app's own data, therefore only 2-legged OAuth token is needed. Everything is frontend. All the REST API calls use AJAX, except for 2-legged OAuth where you should use terminal/commandline to get your access token.

### To deploy

You can download this repo and use a simple local server. With python you can get `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
